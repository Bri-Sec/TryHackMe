# TryHackMe

## Objective

During my master's degree I noticed a lack of practical experience, TryHackMe rooms seemed like a good way to get beginner hands-on practical experience in several different topics. For this reason I completed several different types of rooms. Namely, rooms related to my course material to get a deeper understanding of the course material, rooms in the learning roadmap since these were recommended and rooms that I thought looked fun and interesting and I wanted to personally know more about.

### Skills Learned

- Networking fundamentals (IP, DNS, HTTP/S)
- Basic web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, forms)
- In-depth Nmap scanning and enumeration
- Exploitation using Metasploit and manual techniques
- Privilege escalation (Windows & Linux)
- Post-exploitation and persistence
